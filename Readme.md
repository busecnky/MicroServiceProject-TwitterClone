# Twitter Clone
This repository contains a Twitter clone application developed collaboratively by [Your Name] and [Friend's Name]. The application utilizes microservices architecture and incorporates a wide range of technologies including Spring, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, GCloud, Kubernetes, and Docker. The project demonstrates our proficiency in building scalable, distributed systems and showcases our expertise in leveraging modern software development practices.

## Features
The Twitter clone application offers the following features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile.
Post Creation and Viewing: Users can create new posts, view posts from other users, and interact with them through likes, comments, and shares.
Friend Management: Users can add friends, view their friend's posts, and receive updates on their activities.
Commenting: Users can comment on posts and engage in conversations with other users.
Real-time Notifications: Users receive real-time notifications for activities such as new comments, likes, and friend requests.

#### Technologies Used
The application incorporates the following technologies:
Spring: We utilized the Spring framework to develop the microservices, handle API requests, and manage the application's business logic.
PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is used as the main database to store user information, posts, comments, and other relevant data.
RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ is used as a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices.
Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is utilized for efficient and scalable searching and indexing of posts and comments.
GCloud: The application is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, leveraging its infrastructure and services to ensure scalability, availability, and performance.
Kubernetes: Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, allowing us to manage and scale the application's microservices effectively.
Docker: Docker is used to containerize the application's microservices, providing consistency and ease of deployment.
